# PrismNet_analysis
the analysis script for PrismNet paper:
Predicting dynamic cellular protein-RNA interactions using deep learning and in vivo RNA structure

# structurally_variable_site
The scripts are used to calculate the structure change distance score of transcipt regions and and search the structurally variable sites between different cell. We provided the result of structurally variable sites between each pair of cell lines.

# RBP_binding_site
We provided some examples of PrismNet prediction result, including the RBPs binding probability of sliding window (101nt) in transcripts of different cell lines.

# RBP_binding_function
The scripts are used to calculate the correlation between PrismNet predicted RBP binding and RNA half-life, translation efficiency and splicing.

# motif_analysis
The scripts are used for the integrative motif construction, motif clustering, motif significant analysis and motif scanning. We provided the result of integrative motif of PrismNet model.

# HAR_analysis
The scripts are used to search high attention region (HAR).

# riboSNitch
The scripts are used for riboSNitch finding and the analysis of relationship between riboSNitches and human disease. We provided the result of riboSNitch between each pair of cell lines.
